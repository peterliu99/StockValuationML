This project is a stock valuation algorithm which uses machine learning.

Running the algorithm involves:
	1) Training a neural network for each company stock using nn_train.R
	2) Predicting stock price for specific dates using nn_predict.R

The program is currently written in R, but will likely be translated to Python in the future. RStudio can be used to run R scripts.

doc.pdf explains the methods used and contains code documentation.
